[Emulator]

# CacheEnabled set to true to enable loading apps from GCF.
# If it is true, and a clientregistry.blob file is not supplied,
# then you must supply revApps.ini file with the correct cache requirements.
# See the example revApps.ini, however it is highly recommended that you use
# a clientregistry.blob file for maximum compatibility.
#
CacheEnabled=False

# CachePath - set to the folder where your GCF files are located.
#
#CachePath=E:\Steam\SteamApps

# CDRPath - set to raw CDR blob path.
# By default, the emulator looks for cdr.bin next to rev.ini.
#
#CDRPath = cdr.bin

# Language - the emulator will automagically load the correct language files.
# This can be English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, sChinese,
# Korean, Koreana, tChinese, Japanese, Russian, Thai, or Portugeuse
#
# The emulator will try to set the Language key in the following order:
#		Use the Language key in the this rev.ini if it is present
#		Use the Steam Language key in the registry if it is present
#		Default the Language to English
#
Language=English

# Change Logging to True to enable/disable log file output for steam.dll.
#
Logging=False

# Change SteamDll to point to your official Steam client DLL.
# This setting is required for Steam UserID Validation functions
# to support legit Steam IDs. Otherwise, all clients would get
# IDs generated from their IP addresses.
# Also make sure you uncomment the line below (remove "#")
# if you want to use this setting!
#
#SteamDll=C:\Program Files (x86)\Valve\Steam\Steam.dll

# Change SteamUser to Steam username that you wish to use with the emulator.
# Defaults to RevUser if not specified.
